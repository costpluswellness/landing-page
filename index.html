          Misaligned incentives have broken our healthcare system. Self-funded employers - covering 100 million Americans - are locked into opaque contracts, with no visibility into negotiated rates and no way to meaningfully impact employee health outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, providers are stuck chasing down patients for collection, often forced to raise prices just to manage the financial risk of unpaid deductibles set by health insurance companies. Both the providers and employers (the purchasers) are handcuffed by denials that aren‚Äôt clinically relevant and utilization management reviews that only serve to delay care. As a result, costs increase and employee productivity plummets.
        </p>

        <p>
          We created Cost Plus Wellness to reimagine health care from the ground up.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cost Plus Wellness is an open-source project that empowers employers to work directly with health care providers in a transparent way. Our model is simple: employers contract directly with providers and guarantee full and prompt payment for services rendered. That means no out-of-pocket costs for the employee, no prior authorizations, and no delays in collecting payments for the provider. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting with Mark‚Äôs own companies across the country, we are delivering a better experience for employees and their families while reducing administrative burden for our local doctors‚Äô offices and hospitals. Without the burden of collection, medical necessity reviews, and pre-certifications,providers can focus on what they do best: helping people get better.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe that true cost transparency is the key to building trust. Like we‚Äôve done with <a href="https://costplusdrugs.com" target="_blank">Cost Plus Drugs</a>, we‚Äôre publishing our price list for anyone to see - employers, providers, and the public. We're also making our full contract terms publicly available.
        </p>
        <p>
          We encourage all self-funded employers to compare our pricing and terms to their current contracts and claims history. Any employer can reach out to the providers we‚Äôve contracted and sign on to our same contracts as well - you can find unsigned versions of each provider contract <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D41XEiMPulZd1jhf33AQYdnuVmfrAs1Z?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. Cost Plus Wellness can also facilitate these agreements for employers at no cost.
        </p>

        <p>
          Change will happen fast when companies act in their own best interest and that of their employees. So, if you‚Äôre an employer of any size, reach out using the form below and we can help you figure out the best way to work with our contracts.
