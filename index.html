          Misaligned incentives have broken our healthcare system. Self-funded employers are locked into opaque contracts, with no visibility into negotiated rates and no way to meaningfully impact employee health outcomes. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, providers are stuck chasing down patients for collection, often forced to raise prices just to manage the financial risk of unpaid deductibles. Both parties are handcuffed by denials that aren’t clinically relevant and utilization management reviews that only serve to delay care. As a result, costs increase and employee productivity plummets. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Rising costs and declining levels of service have prompted us to reimagine healthcare from the ground up. That’s why we created Cost Plus Wellness. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Cost Plus Wellness is a movement that empowers employers to work directly with health care providers in a transparent way, keeping costs flat if not seeing them trend down. Our model is simple: employers contract directly with providers and guarantee full and prompt payment for all services rendered. That means no deductibles, no out-of-pocket costs for the employee, no prior authorizations, and no delays in collecting payments for the provider. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting with Mark Cuban’s own companies across the country, we are delivering a better experience for employees and their families while making life easier for the administrative staff at our local doctors’ offices. Without the burden of collection, providers can focus on what they do best: providing high quality care. And they are rewarded with trust, autonomy, and favorable payment terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe that true cost transparency is the key to building trust. Like we’ve done with <a href="https://costplusdrugs.com" target="_blank">Cost Plus Drugs</a>, we’re publishing our price list for anyone to see - employers, providers, and the public. In fact, we're taking transparency to a new level by making our full contract terms available. Everyone deserves to know how their health care is administered, which is why providers have agreed to open source our contracts. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Change will happen fast when companies act in their own best interest and that of their employees. So, if you’re an employer of any size, reach out at <a href="mailto:getinvolved@costpluswellness.com">getinvolved@costpluswellness.com</a> to learn how you can lower your costs and improve your employees' health outcomes.
